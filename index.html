        In JavaScript, null and undefined are two different values that represent the absence of a value.

        undefined is a value that is automatically assigned to variables that are declared but not initialized. For example:
        
        javascript
        Copy code
        let name;
        console.log(name); // outputs: undefined
        null, on the other hand, is a value that you can explicitly assign to a variable to indicate that it doesn't have a value. For example:
        
        javascript
        Copy code
        let name = null;
        console.log(name); // outputs: null
        In practice, null is often used to represent the intentional absence of an object reference, while undefined is used to represent the unintentional absence of a value. For example, you might use null to indicate that a certain object property doesn't have a value, while undefined might be used to indicate that a variable has not been assigned a value yet.
